## 🎨 Design

The UI fuses traditional japanese art with elements of popculture (emoji, drawn-by-hand elements). 

## 💡 Idea

Learning in this app is based on self-assesment. There is no rush nor pressure. Each round consists of 5 characters but a user can leave the round at any time and progress will still be saved.
The user decides if they need more practice on a given character or not. It is always possible to compare their answer or get a hint.


## ↗️ Directions of growth

- [ ] Give hints as separate strokes (as the API progresses)
- [ ] Add readings to listen to and practice along
